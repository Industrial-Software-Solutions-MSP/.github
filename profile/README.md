## Industrial Software Solutions MSP
This organization is a collaborative project created by Chris Bennet, Robert Coltharp, Jonathan McMullin, Carlos Rojas, and Nicholas Van Noort. The projects simulates a pitch by a Managed Service Provider team to provide IT support to a small specialized software company that manages industrial control systems. The company is primed to expand its marketshare but requires an MSP to revamp its security policy and provision the appropriate computer systems.
